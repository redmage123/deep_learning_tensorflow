enough comedy that should have found a summer place . \nbranagh , in his most forceful non-shakespeare screen performance , grounds even the softest moments in the angry revolt of his wit . \nthough the violence is far less sadistic than usual , the film is typical miike : fast , furious and full of off-the-cuff imaginative flourishes . \ncompelling as it is exotic , fast runner has a plot that rivals shakespeare for intrigue , treachery and murder . \nwhat it lacks in originality it makes up for in intelligence and b-grade stylishness . \nthe warm presence of zhao benshan makes the preposterous lying hero into something more than he reasonably should be . \nthis is as powerful a set of evidence as you\'ll ever find of why art matters , and how it can resonate far beyond museum walls and through to the most painfully marginal lives . \ndirector rob marshall went out gunning to make a great one . \nskip work to see it at the first opportunity . \nbow\'s best moments are when he\'s getting busy on the basketball court because that\'s when he really scores . \noffers enough playful fun to entertain the preschool set while embracing a wholesome attitude . \nin the end , punch-drunk love is one of those films that i wanted to like much more than i actually did . sometimes , that\'s enough . \nan intimate , good-humored ethnic comedy like numerous others but cuts deeper than expected . \nice cube holds the film together with an engaging and warm performance . . . \nboth deeply weird and charmingly dear . \nas blunt as it is in depicting child abuse , el bola is a movie steeped in an ambiguity that lends its conflicts a symbolic resonance . \ndespite a story predictable enough to make the sound of music play like a nail-biting thriller , its heart is so much in the right place it is difficult to get really peeved at it . \nit\'s a masterpiece . \nan incredibly low-rent danish film , it brings a group of people together in a sweet and charming way , if a little convenient\nit\'s the cinematic equivalent of a good page-turner , and even if it\'s nonsense , its claws dig surprisingly deep . \ndirector nalin pan doesn\'t do much to weigh any arguments one way or the other . he simply presents his point of view that ayurveda works . no question . \nwhat " empire " lacks in depth it makes up for with its heart . \nclaude miller airs out a tight plot with an easy pace and a focus on character drama over crime-film complications . \nwhat full frontal lacks in thematic coherence it largely makes up for as loosey-goosey , experimental entertainment . still , i\'m not quite sure what the point is\x85\nrich in detail , gorgeously shot and beautifully acted , les destinees is , in its quiet , epic way , daring , inventive and refreshingly unusual . \n ( a ) hollywood sheen bedevils the film from the very beginning . . . ( but ) lohman\'s moist , deeply emotional eyes shine through this bogus veneer . . . \ndo we really need a 77-minute film to tell us exactly why a romantic relationship between a 15-year-old boy and a 40-year-old woman doesn\'t work ? \nford deserves to be remembered at oscar time for crafting this wonderful portrait of a conflicted soldier . \nthe film\'s 45-minute running time stops shy of overkill , though viewers may be more exhausted than the athletes onscreen . \ndon\'t expect any surprises in this checklist of teamwork cliches . . . \nas adapted by kevin molony from simon leys\' novel " the death of napoleon " and directed by alan taylor , napoleon\'s journey is interesting but his parisian rebirth is stillborn\nthe movie addresses a hungry need for pg-rated , nonthreatening family movies , but it doesn\'t go too much further . \nthis warm and gentle romantic comedy has enough interesting characters to fill several movies , and its ample charms should win over the most hard-hearted cynics . \na yarn that respects the marvel version without becoming ensnared by it . \nthis is a happy throwback to the time when cartoons were cinema\'s most idiosyncratic form instead of one of its most predictable . \ncomplex , affecting and uniquely almod\xf3var , the film evokes strong emotions and pushes viewers to question their deepest notions of moral right and wrong . \ngood ol\' urban legend stuff . \nnot so much a movie as a picture book for the big screen . this isn\'t my favorite in the series , still i enjoyed it enough to recommend . \nit\'s one of the most honest films ever made about hollywood . \nit is a film that will have people walking out halfway through , will encourage others to stand up and applaud , and will , undoubtedly , leave both camps engaged in a ferocious debate for years to come . \non its own cinematic terms , it successfully showcases the passions of both the director and novelist byatt . \nlight , silly , photographed with colour and depth , and rather a good time . \npray\'s film works well and will appeal even to those who aren\'t too familiar with turntablism . \ntroubling and powerful . \ngood movie . good actress . but if you expect light romantic comedy , good gosh , will you be shocked . \nit has the courage to wonder about big questions with sincerity and devotion . it risks seeming slow and pretentious , because it thinks the gamble is worth the promise . \nwith youthful high spirits , tautou remains captivating throughout michele\'s religious and romantic quests , and she is backed by a likable cast . \nit\'s an example of sophisticated , challenging filmmaking that stands , despite its noticeable lack of emotional heft , in welcome contrast to the indulgent dead-end experimentation of the director\'s previous full frontal . \na very funny look at how another culture handles the process of courting and marriage . \nbut tongue-in-cheek preposterousness has always been part of for the most part wilde\'s droll whimsy helps " being earnest " overcome its weaknesses and parker\'s creative interference . . . \nmuch of the movie\'s charm lies in the utter cuteness of stuart and margolo . their computer-animated faces are very expressive . \nthe path ice age follows most closely , though , is the one established by warner bros . giant chuck jones , who died a matter of weeks before the movie\'s release . \nanchored by a terrific performance by abbass , satin rouge shows that the idea of women\'s self-actualization knows few continental divides . \nawkward but sincere and , ultimately , it wins you over . \nsmith profiles five extraordinary american homes , and because the owners seem fully aware of the uses and abuses of fame , it\'s a pleasure to enjoy their eccentricities . \nthough the plot is predictable , the movie never feels formulaic , because the attention is on the nuances of the emotional development of the delicate characters . \nsam jones became a very lucky filmmaker the day wilco got dropped from their record label , proving that one man\'s ruin may be another\'s fortune . \ngoyer\'s screenplay and direction are thankfully understated , and he has drawn excellent performances from his cast . \nbinoche and magimel are perfect in these roles . \nwhen your leading ladies are a couple of screen-eating dominatrixes like goldie hawn and susan sarandon at their raunchy best , even hokum goes down easily . \nwhile undercover brother is definitely one for the masses , it\'s also full of sharp , smart satire . \ngets under the skin of a man who has just lost his wife . \nit may not be " last tango in paris " but . . . \nno wonder they\'re talking about " talk to her . " it\'s astonishing . \nfor its seriousness , high literary aspirations and stunning acting , the film can only be applauded . \nlook , this is a terrific flick replete with dazzling camera-work ,

tone than its predecessor , as cho appears to have settled comfortably into her skin . \nfor the first time in several years , mr . allen has surpassed himself with the magic he\'s spun with the hollywood empress of ms . leoni\'s ellie . \nisn\'t quite the equal of woo\'s best earlier work , but it\'s easily his finest american film . . . comes close to recapturing the brilliance of his hong

sure you\'re getting its metaphysical point . \na modest pleasure that accomplishes its goals with ease and confidence . \na breezy , diverting , conventional , well-acted tale of two men locked in an ongoing game of cat-and-cat . \nwhat jackson has accomplished here is amazing on a technical level . \nas teen movies go , " orange county " is a refreshing change\nmakes s&m seem very romantic , and maggie gyllenhaal is a delight . \na deliciously mordant , bitter black comedy . \nalthough life or something like it is very much in the mold of feel-good movies , the cast and director stephen herek\'s polished direction pour delightfully piquant wine from aged bottles . \nit is risky , intelligent , romantic and rapturous from start to finish . \nthe movie sticks much closer to hornby\'s drop-dead confessional tone than the film version of high fidelity did . \na pleasant ramble through the sort of idoosyncratic terrain that errol morris has often dealt with . . . it does possess a loose , lackadaisical charm . \n . . . spiced with humor ( \'i speak fluent flatula , \' advises denlopp after a rather , er , bubbly exchange with an alien deckhand ) and witty updatings ( silver\'s parrot has been replaced with morph , a cute alien creature who mimics everyone and everything around ) \nthis is a raw and disturbing tale that took five years to make , and the trio\'s absorbing narrative is a heart-wrenching showcase indeed . \na beautiful and haunting examination of the stories we tell ourselves to make sense of the mundane horrors of the world . \naside from being the funniest movie of the year , simone , andrew niccol\'s brilliant anti-hollywood satire , has a wickedly eccentric enchantment to it . \nwatstein handily directs and edits around his screenplay\'s sappier elements . . . and sustains off the hook\'s buildup with remarkable assuredness for a first-timer . \njust another fish-out-of-water story that barely stays afloat . \nthere\'s an energy to y tu mam\xe1 tambi\xe9n . much of it comes from the brave , uninhibited performances by its lead actors . \nit\'s the kind of pigeonhole-resisting romp that hollywood too rarely provides . \nreinforces the often forgotten fact of the world\'s remarkably varying human population and mindset , and its capacity to heal using creative , natural and ancient antidotes . \nyou can feel the heat that ignites this gripping tale , and the humor and humanity that root it in feeling . \nit\'s hard not to be seduced by [witherspoon\'s] charisma , even in this run-of-the-mill vehicle , because this girl knows how to drive it to the max . \na movie for 11-year-old boys with sports dreams of their own and the preteen girls who worship lil\' bow wow . \na refreshingly authentic coming-of-age tale . \nif you\'re not into the pokemon franchise , this fourth animated movie in four years won\'t convert you -- or even keep your eyes open . but fans should have fun meeting a brand-new pokemon called celebi . \nfrom the big giant titles of the opening credits to elmer bernstein\'s perfectly melodic score , haynes gets just about everything right . \nwhether seen on a 10-inch television screen or at your local multiplex , the edge-of-your-seat , educational antics of steve irwin are priceless entertainment . \nhas a shambling charm . . . a cheerfully inconsequential diversion . \nferrara directs the entire film with the kind of detachment that makes any given frame look like a family\'s custom-made christmas card . \nthe movie has lots of dancing and fabulous music . there are slow and repetitive parts , but it has just enough spice to keep it interesting . \nan incredibly clever and superbly paced caper filled with scams within scams within scams . \nthere\'s not much more to this adaptation of the nick hornby novel than charm -- effortless , pleasurable , featherweight charm . \nas a belated nod to some neglected all-stars , standing in the shadows of motown is cultural history of the best kind : informative , revealing and richly entertaining . \neven if the ride\'s a little bumpy , with a final lap that\'s all too suspiciously smooth , you gotta give director roger michell , best known for the superfluous notting hill , credit for trying . \nnot as distinctive or even as humorous as its needs to be to stand out , but it has clearly been made with affection and care . \nthis is carion\'s debut feature but his script and direction hums with a confidence that many spend entire careers trying to reach . \nan intelligent , moving and invigorating film . \nofrece una buena oportunidad de cultura ( aunque sea condensada ) que bien vale la pena aprovechar . \n . . . one of the most ingenious and entertaining thrillers i\'ve seen in quite a long time . \na clever blend of

authentic . \nflavorful and romantic , you could call this how martha got her groove back -- assuming , that is , she ever had one to begin with . \nhappily for mr . chin -- though unhappily for his subjects -- the invisible hand of the marketplace wrote a script that no human screenwriter could have hoped to match . \nthurman and lewis are hilarious throughout . \nthe plot is so amusingly contrived and outlandish in its coincidences that no one could ever mistake it for anything resembling reality\nhits one out of the park for the \'they don\'t make \'em like that anymore\' department . \nit dares to be a little different , and that shading is what makes it worthwhile . \n[fessenden] is much more into ambiguity and creating mood than he is for on screen thrills\nthe comic performances are all spot on , especially lee ross\'s turn as ken . \na compelling journey . . . and " his best friend remembers " is up there with the finest of specials . \nat nearly three hours , the whole of safe conduct is less than the sum of its parts . \nthe hours makes you examine your own life in much the same way its characters do , and the experience is profound . the hours is what movies are supposed to be . . . \na bold and subversive film that cuts across the grain of what is popular and powerful in this high-tech age , speaking its truths with spellbinding imagery and the entrancing music of philip glass . \npretty darn good , despite its smarty-pants aura . \nso young , so smart , such talent , such a wise . \nwoo\'s fights have a distinct flair . his warriors collide in balletic explosion that implies an underlying order throughout the chaos . \nbarney has created a tour de force that is weird , wacky and wonderful . \nthe ending does leave you unfulfilled , but these are performances to enjoy in a memorable ensemble piece . \n . . . an agreeable time-wasting device -- but george pal\'s low-tech 1960 version still rules the epochs . \nit\'s a brave attempt to tap into the heartbeat of the world , a salute to the universal language of rhythm and a zippy sampling of sounds . \noffers an unusual opportunity to observe the inequities in the death penalty , not just the inherent immorality but also the haphazard administration of it and public misperception of how the whole thing works . \ni don\'t think i\'ve been as entranced and appalled by an asian film since shinya tsukamoto\'s iron man . \nit is so refreshing to see robin williams turn 180 degrees from the string of insultingly innocuous and sappy fiascoes he\'s been making for the last several years . \ndirector benoit jacquot , making his first opera-to-film translation with tosca , conveys the heaving passion of puccini\'s famous love-jealousy- murder-suicide fandango with great cinematic innovation . \nlilia\'s transformation from strict mother to sensual siren is superficially preposterous , but abbas infuses the role with an unimpeachable core of emotional truth . \nfrida\'s artistic brilliance is undeniable -- it\'s among the most breathtakingly designed films i\'ve ever seen . \nthe perfect film for those who like sick comedies that can be snide . \n\'charly\' will divide its audience in two separate groups , those reaching for more tissues and those begging for mercy . . . \nnervy and sensitive , it taps into genuine artistic befuddlement , and at the same time presents a scathing indictment of what drives hollywood . \na marvellous journey from childhood idealism to adolescent self-absorption . \nthe film is just a big , gorgeous , mind-blowing , breath-taking mess . \nsharp , lively , funny and ultimately sobering film . \nthough the film\'s scenario is certainly not earthshaking , this depiction of fluctuating female sexuality has two winning lead performances and charm to spare . \na worthy tribute to a great humanitarian and her vibrant \'co-stars . \'\na recent favourite at sundance , this white-trash satire will inspire the affection of even those unlucky people who never owned a cassette of def leppard\'s pyromania . \nthe recording session is the only part of the film that is enlightening -- and how appreciative you are of this depends on your level of fandom . \noccasionally funny and consistently odd , and it works reasonably well as a star vehicle for zhao . \nbright seems alternately amused and disgusted with this material , and he can\'t help throwing in a few of his own touches . \nthe 3d images only enhance the film\'s otherworldly quality , giving it a strange combo of you-are-there closeness with the disorienting unreality of the seemingly broken-down fourth wall of the movie screen . \nandersson creates a world that\'s at once surreal and disturbingly familiar ; absurd , yet tremendously sad . \nit\'s predictable , but it jumps through the expected hoops with style and even some depth . \noften hilarious , well-shot and , importantly , entertaining , hell house is a fascinating document of an event that has to be seen to be believed . \nde oliveira creates an emotionally rich , poetically plump and visually fulsome , but never showy , film whose bittersweet themes are reinforced and brilliantly personified by michel piccoli . \n . . . an inviting piece of film . \nthe film\'s real appeal won\'t be to clooney fans or adventure buffs , but to moviegoers who enjoy thinking about compelling questions with no easy answers . \nthe fact that the rookie is a nearly impeccable cinematic experience -- and a wonderful all-ages triumph besides -- is a miracle akin to the story the film portrays . \na deviant topical comedy which is funny from start to finish . \na startling and fresh examination of how the bike still remains an ambiguous icon in chinese society . \na highly

to hear madame d . refer to her husband as \'jackie\' -- and he does make for excellent company , not least as a self-conscious performer . \nthe film often achieves a mesmerizing poetry . \nmore than

" \nthis horror-comedy doesn\'t go for the usual obvious laughs at the expense of cheap-looking monsters -- unless you count elvira\'s hooters . \nthe movie\'s eventual success should be credited to

realism . \nan emotionally strong and politically potent piece of cinema . \nenticing and often funny documentary . \ngoing to this movie is a little like chewing whale blubber - it\'s an acquired taste that takes time to enjoy , but it\'s worth it , even if it does take 3 hours to get through . \na portrait of hell so shattering it\'s impossible to shake . \nalmodovar is an imaginative teacher of emotional intelligence in this engaging film about two men who discover what william james once called \'the gift of tears . \'\nbetter than the tepid star trek : insurrection ; falls short of

during the german occupation ; its most delightful moments come when various characters express their quirky inner selves . \na fine documentary can be distinguished from a mediocre one by the better

with vivid characters and a warm , moving message . \nthe stars may be college kids , but the subject matter is as adult as you can get : the temptations of the flesh are unleashed by a slightly crazed , overtly determined young woman and a one-night swim turns into an ocean of trouble . \npretty good little movie . \nby turns touching , raucously amusing , uncomfortable , and , yes , even sexy , never again is a welcome and heartwarming addition to the romantic comedy genre . \nworse than \'silence of the lambs\' better than \'hannibal\'\nif you haven\'t seen the film lately , you may be surprised at the variety of tones in spielberg\'s work . much of it is funny , but there are also some startling , surrealistic moments . . . \n[the digital effects] reminded me of terry gilliam\'s

please history fans . \ncanada\'s arctic light shines bright on this frozen tundra soap opera that breathes extraordinary life into the private existence of the inuit people . \nthe fluid motion is

about a historic legal battle in ireland over a man\'s right to raise his own children . \nyes , it\'s as good as you remember . in fact , even better . \nhartley adds enough quirky and satirical

enjoyable and satisfying evenings at the movies i\'ve had in a while . \nif " lilo & stitch " isn\'t the most edgy piece of disney animation to hit the silver screen , then this first film to use a

awkward and ironic . \nthis ready-made midnight movie probably won\'t stand the cold light of day , but under the right conditions , it\'s goofy ( if not entirely wholesome ) fun . \nsee scratch for the history , see scratch for the music , see scratch for a lesson in scratching , but , most of all , see it for the passion . \n . . . " bowling for columbine " remains a disquieting and thought-provoking film . . . \neven though it is infused with the sensibility of a video director , it doesn\'t make for completely empty entertainment\nbut even with the two-wrongs-make-a-right chemistry between jolie and burns . . . this otherwise appealing picture loses its soul to screenwriting for dummies conformity . \ntalk to her is so darned assured , we have absolutely no idea who the main characters are until the film is well under way -- and yet it\'s hard to stop watching . \nstar/producer salma hayek and director julie

aging sisters . \nwhite oleander may leave you rolling your eyes in the dark , but that doesn\'t mean you won\'t like looking at it . \nin painting an unabashedly romantic picture of a nation whose

brilliant work in this genre since the 1984 uncut version of sergio leone\'s flawed but staggering once upon a time in america . \nit looks closely , insightfully at fragile , complex relationships . \nnot a bad choice here , assuming that . . . the air-conditioning in the theater is working properly . \na fine effort , an interesting topic , some intriguing characters and a sad ending . certainly

reliable , standard disney animated fare , with enough creative energy and wit to entertain all ages . \nmichael moore\'s latest documentary about america\'s thirst for violence is his best film yet . . . \nsuffice to say that after seeing this movie in imax form , you\'ll be more acquainted with the tiniest details of tom hanks\' face than his wife is . \nlike a tarantino movie with heart , alias betty is richly detailed , deftly executed and utterly absorbing . \nmarvelously entertaining and deliriously joyous documentary . \na brisk , reverent , and subtly different sequel . \na movie i

events that led to their notorious rise to infamy . . . \nthis is an undeniably intriguing film from an adventurous young talent who finds his inspiration on the fringes of the american underground . \nthe sweetest thing , a romantic comedy with outrageous tendencies , may be a mess in a lot of ways . but it does have one saving grace . a lot of its gags and observations reflect a woman\'s

exhilarating . \nfans of critics\' darling band wilco will marvel at the sometimes murky , always brooding look of i am trying to break your heart . \nthe film presents visceral and dangerously honest revelations about the men and machines behind the curtains of our planet . \n[gosling\'s] combination of explosive physical energy and convincing intelligence helps create a complex , unpredictable character . \nconfounding because it solemnly advances a daringly preposterous thesis . acting cannot be acted . \nfulford-wierzbicki . . . deftly captures the wise-beyond-her-years teen . \na wild ride juiced with enough energy and excitement for at least three films . \nit\'s a cool event for the whole family . maybe not a classic , but a movie the kids will want to see over and over again . \nfeatherweight romantic comedy has a few nice twists in a standard plot and the charisma of hugh grant and sandra bullock . \nthe movie is not as terrible as the synergistic impulse that created it . \na typically observant , carefully nuanced and intimate french coming-of-age film that is an encouraging debut feature but has a needlessly downbeat ending that is too heavy for all that has preceded it . \nless an examination of neo-nazism than a probe into the nature of faith itself . \na moving and weighty depiction of one family\'s attempts to heal after the death of a child . \ni don\'t think most of the people who loved the 1989 paradiso will prefer this new version . but i do . \na zinger-filled crowd-pleaser that open-minded elvis fans ( but by no means all ) will have fun with . \ndiggs and lathan are among the chief reasons brown sugar is such a sweet and sexy film . \nentirely suspenseful , extremely well-paced and ultimately . . . dare i say , entertaining ! \nthe riveting performances by the incredibly flexible cast make love a joy to behold . \nterrific as nadia , a russian mail-order bride who comes to america speaking not a word of english , it\'s kidman who holds the film together with a supremely kittenish performance that gradually accumulates more layers . \nwith an unflappable air of decadent urbanity , everett remains a perfect wildean actor , and a

series of perfect black pearls clicking together to form a string . we\'re drawn in by the dark luster . \na haunting tale of murder and mayhem . \ni love the opening scenes of a wintry new york city in 1899 . cinematic poetry showcases the city\'s old-world charm before machines change nearly everything . \nit\'s hard to imagine anyone managing to steal a movie not only from charismatic rising star jake gyllenhaal but also from accomplished oscar winners susan sarandon , dustin hoffman and holly hunter , yet newcomer ellen pompeo pulls off the feat with aplomb . \none of the best rock documentaries ever . wilco is a phenomenal band with such an engrossing story that will capture the minds and hearts of many . \nian holm conquers france as an earthy napoleon\noffers big , fat , dumb

brett morgen and nanette burstein have put together a bold biographical fantasia . \nthe subtitled costume drama is set in a remote african empire before cell phones , guns , and the internal combustion engine , but the politics that thump through it are as timely as tomorrow . \na tremendous piece of work . \na delightful , if minor , pastry of a movie . \nwhile obviously aimed at kids , the country bears . . . should keep parents amused with its low groan-to-guffaw ratio . \nlabute masterfully balances both traditional or modern stories together in a manner that one never overwhelms the other . something for everyone . \nirwin is so earnest that it\'s hard to resist his pleas to spare wildlife and respect their environs . there are far worse messages to teach a young audience , which will probably be perfectly happy with the sloppy slapstick comedy . \nleigh succeeds in delivering a dramatic slap in the face that\'s simultaneously painful and refreshing . \nnot about scares but a mood in which an ominous , pervasive , and unknown threat lurks just below the proceedings and adds an almost constant mindset of suspense . \n\'film aficionados cannot help but love cinema paradiso , whether the original version or new director\'s cut . \'\na fascinating glimpse into an insular world that gives the lie to many clich\xe9s and showcases a group of dedicated artists .

it in the most unexpected way . \ncould i have been more geeked when i heard that apollo 13 was going to be released in imax format ? in a word : no . \nmurderous maids has a lot going for it , not least the brilliant performances by testud . . . and parmentier . \nfilmmaker stacy peralta has a flashy editing style that doesn\'t always jell with sean penn\'s monotone narration , but he respects the material without sentimentalizing it . \nthere are a couple of things that elevate " glory " above most of its ilk , most notably the mere presence of duvall . \nit\'s light on the chills and heavy on the atmospheric weirdness , and there are moments of jaw-droppingly odd behavior -- yet i found it weirdly appealing . \n ( rises ) above its oh-so-hollywood rejiggering and its conventional direction to give the film a soul and an unabashed sense of good old-fashioned escapism . \na breezy blend of art , history , esoteric musings and philosophy . \nkids will love its fantasy and adventure , and grownups should appreciate its whimsical humor . \ntsai ming-liang\'s ghosts are painfully aware of their not-being . \nleaping from one arresting image to another , songs from the

an 8th grade boy delving into required reading . \nstands as a document of what it felt like to be a new yorker -- or , really , to be a human being -- in the weeks after 9/11 . \ni am not generally a huge fan of cartoons derived from tv shows , but hey arnold ! the movie is clever , offbeat and even gritty enough to overcome my resistance . \nwith not a lot of help from the screenplay ( proficient , but singularly cursory ) , [testud] acts with the feral intensity of the young bette davis . \nit\'s a film that\'s destined to win a wide summer audience through word-of-mouth reviews and , not far

uncompromising film . \nthat \'alabama\' manages to be pleasant in spite of its predictability and occasional slowness is due primarily to the perkiness of witherspoon ( who is always a joy to watch ,

realize that deep inside righteousness can be found a tough beauty . \nwhat it lacks in substance it makes up for in heart . \nrobert harmon\'s less-is-more approach delivers real bump-in -the-night

promotes a reasonable landscape of conflict and pathos to support the scattershot terrorizing tone\nin auteil\'s less dramatic but equally incisive performance , he\'s a charismatic charmer likely to

startling use of close-ups and her grace with a moving camera , creates sheerly cinematic appeal . \nthe son of the bride\'s humour is born out of an engaging storyline , which also isn\'t embarrassed to make you reach for the tissues . this movie is to be cherished . \n . . . a visually seductive , unrepentantly trashy take on rice\'s second installment of her vampire chronicles . \nthe story\'s scope and pageantry are mesmerizing , and mr . day-lewis roars with leonine power . \np . t . anderson understands the grandness of romance and how love is the great equalizer that can calm us of our daily ills and bring out joys in our lives that we never knew were possible . \ntwenty years later , e . t . is still a cinematic touchstone . \nthis fascinating experiment plays as more of a poetic than a strict reality , creating an intriguing species of artifice that gives the lady and the duke something of a theatrical air . \nit\'s virtually impossible to like any of these despicable characters . \nthis is mostly well-constructed fluff , which is all it seems intended to be . \neven through its flaws , revolution #9 proves to be a compelling , interestingly told film . \nthe best

, at bottom , a sophisticated flower child\'s desire to purge the world of the tooth and claw of human power . \nthere is no denying the power of polanski\'s film . . . \nthe movie is amateurish , but

bit of storytelling . \nsatin rouge is not a new , or inventive , journey , but it\'s encouraging to see a three-dimensional , average , middle-aged woman\'s experience of self-discovery handled with such sensitivity . \nthough an important political documentary , this does not really make the case the kissinger should be tried as a war criminal . \ncannon\'s confidence and laid-back good spirits

brittle delivery that gives the film its bittersweet bite . \nimpossible as it may sound , this film\'s heart is even more embracing than monty , if only because it accepts nasty behavior and severe flaws as part of the human condition . \ndespite the predictable parent vs . child coming-of-age theme , first-class , natural acting and a look at " the real americans " make this a charmer . \none of the smarter offerings the horror genre has produced in recent memory , even if it\'s far tamer than advertised . \none of recent memory\'s most thoughtful films about art , ethics , and the cost of

your date behind for this one , or she\'s gonna make you feel like you owe her big-time . \nthe message is that even the most unlikely can link together to conquer all kinds of obstacles , whether

an impressive job of relating the complicated history of the war and of filling in the background . \nit\'s all about anakin . . . and the lustrous polished visuals rich in color and creativity and , of course , special effect . \nlacks the inspiration of the original and has a bloated plot that stretches the running time about 10 minutes past a child\'s interest and an adult\'s patience . but it

live-wire film that never loses its ability to shock and amaze . \nthe year\'s greatest adventure , and jackson\'s limited but enthusiastic adaptation has made literature literal without killing its soul -- a feat any thinking person is bound to appreciate . \nit\'s fairly solid--not to mention well edited so that it certainly doesn\'t feel like a film that strays past the two and a half mark .

has claws enough to get inside you and stay there for a couple of hours . \nthe hours , a delicately crafted film , is an impressive achievement in spite of a river of sadness that pours into every frame . \nfudges fact and fancy with such confidence that we feel as if we\'re seeing something purer than the real thing . \nthis is unusual , food-for-thought cinema that\'s as entertaining as it is instructive . \nwith an expressive face reminiscent of gong li and a vivid personality like zhang ziyi\'s , dong stakes out the emotional heart of happy . \nnohe\'s documentary about the event is sympathetic without being gullible : he isn\'t blind to the silliness , but also captures moments of spontaneous creativity and authentic co-operative interaction . \nit may not be as cutting , as witty or as true as back in the glory days of weekend and two or three things i know about her , but who else engaged in filmmaking today is so cognizant of the cultural and moral issues involved in the process ? \nsecret ballot is a funny , puzzling movie ambiguous enough to be engaging and oddly moving . \nalthough devoid of objectivity and full of nostalgic comments from the now middle-aged

merited . \nsad to say -- it accurately reflects the rage and alienation that fuels the self-destructiveness of many young people . \nthere is a strong directorial stamp on every frame of this stylish

that come by once in a while with flawless amounts of acting , direction , story and pace . \nthe aaa of action , xxx is a blast of adrenalin , rated eee for excitement . and vin diesel is the man . \nearnest , unsubtle and hollywood-predictable , green dragon is still a deeply moving effort to put a human face on the travail of thousands of vietnamese . \nan ambitious movie that , like shiner\'s organizing of the big fight , pulls off enough of its effects to make up for the ones that don\'t come off . \nnair and writer laura cahill dare to build a movie around some flawed but rather unexceptional women , emerging with a fine character study that\'s short on plot but rich in the tiny revelations of real life . \nthe film\'s unhurried pace is actually one of its strengths .

haunting film . \nvibrantly colored and beautifully designed , metropolis is a feast for the eyes . \nsweetly sexy , funny and touching . \n . . . while dark water isn\'t a complete wash ( no pun

powerful and reasonably fulfilling gestalt . \nbursting through the constraints of its source , this is one adapted- from-television movie that actually looks as if it belongs on the big screen . \n .

study . yet this one makes up for in heart what it lacks in outright newness . plus , like i already mentioned . . . it\'s robert duvall ! c\'mon ! \nthis story of a determined woman\'s courage to find her husband in a war zone offers winning performances and some effecting moments . \nlike shrek , spirit\'s visual imagination reminds you of why animation is such a perfect medium for children , because of the way it allows the mind to enter and accept another world . \na modestly made but profoundly moving documentary . \nit irritates and saddens me that martin lawrence\'s latest vehicle can explode obnoxiously into 2 , 500 screens while something of bubba ho-tep\'s clearly evident quality may end up languishing on a shelf somewhere . \nnot everything in this ambitious comic escapade works , but coppola , along with his sister , sofia , is a real filmmaker . it must be in the genes . \nthe performers are so spot on , it is hard to conceive anyone else in their roles . \nthis slight premise . . . works because of the ideal casting of the masterful british actor ian holm as the aged napoleon . \nhashiguchi covers this territory with wit and originality , suggesting that with his fourth feature -- the first to be released in the u . s . -- a major director is emerging in world cinema . \nalthough the film boils down to a lightweight story about matchmaking , the characters make italian for beginners worth the journey\nthe dragons are the real stars of reign of fire and you won\'t be disappointed . \nkudos to the most enchanting film of the year . \nit works well enough , since the thrills pop up frequently , and the dispatching of the cast is as often imaginative as it is gory . \ncolorful and deceptively buoyant until it suddenly pulls the rug out from under you , burkinabe filmmaker dani kouyate\'s reworking of a folk story whose roots go back to 7th-century oral traditions is also a pointed political allegory . \nit\'s a powerful though flawed movie , guaranteed to put a lump in your throat while reaffirming washington as possibly the best actor working in movies today . \ndirector paul cox\'s unorthodox , abstract approach to visualizing nijinsky\'s diaries is both stimulating and demanding . \nfor 95 often hilarious minutes , [cho] riffs on the diciness of colonics , on straight versus gay personal ads , on how men would act if they had periods , and on the perils of a certain outr\xe9 sexual practice . \nmost of the things that made the original men in black such a pleasure are still there . \nmostly honest , this somber picture reveals itself slowly , intelligently , artfully . \nbest enjoyed as a work of fiction inspired by real-life events . those seeking a definitive account of eisenstein\'s life would do better elsewhere . \n[westbrook] makes a wonderful subject for the camera . \na film that\'s flawed and brilliant in equal measure . \neven if invincible is not quite the career peak that the pianist is for roman polanski , it demonstrates that werner herzog can still leave us with a sense of wonder at the diverse , marvelously twisted shapes history has taken . \nultimately too repellent to fully endear itself to american art house audiences , but it is notable for its stylistic austerity and forcefulness . \nhardly a film that comes along every day . \nharmless fun . \na wild ride with eight boarders from venice beach that was a deserved co-winner of the audience award for documentaries at the sundance film festival . \nthe film\'s only missteps come from the script\'s insistence on providing deep emotional motivation for each and every one of abagnale\'s antics . \na sweet , tender sermon about a 12-year-old welsh boy more curious about god than girls , who learns that believing in something does matter . \nthe film belongs to the marvelous verdu , a sexy slip of an earth mother who mourns her tragedies in private and embraces life in public\nmore intimate than spectacular , e . t . is carried less by wow factors than by its funny , moving yarn that holds up well after two decades . \nfor once , a movie does not proclaim the truth about two love-struck somebodies , but permits them time and space to convince us of that all on their own . \nif you\'re burnt out on it\'s a wonderful life marathons and bored with a christmas carol , it might just be the movie you\'re looking for . it depends on how well flatulence gags fit into your holiday concept . \nmoonlight mile doesn\'t quite go the distance but the cast is impressive and they all give life to these broken characters who are trying to make their way through this tragedy . \nit is an indelible epic american story about two families , one black and one white , facing change in both their inner and outer lives . \nnot as well-written as sexy beast , not as gloriously flippant as lock , stock and two smoking barrels , but stylish and moody and exceptionally well-acted . \nquite simply , a joy to watch and--especially--to listen to . \na flawed film but an admirable one that tries to immerse us in a world of artistic abandon and political madness and very nearly succeeds . \nthe filmmakers wisely decided to let crocodile hunter steve irwin do what he does best , and fashion a story around him . \na winning and wildly fascinating work . \nwe do get the distinct impression that this franchise is drawing to a close . \nworth catching for griffiths\' warm and winning central performance . \nthe tone errs on the shrill side , tempered by a soft southern gentility that speaks of beauty , grace and a closet full of skeletons . \nan interesting psychological game of cat-and-mouse , three-dimensional characters and believable performances all add up to a satisfying crime drama . \na meatier deeper beginning and/or ending would have easily tipped this film into the " a " range , as is , it\'s a very very strong " b+ . " i love the robust middle of this picture . \nthe power of shanghai ghetto , a documentary by dana janklowicz-mann and amir mann , rests in the voices of men and women , now in their 70s , who lived there in the 1940s . \nmaintains your interest until the end and even leaves you with a few lingering animated thoughts . \nthere is a beautiful , aching sadness to it all . paul cox needed to show it . it is up to you to decide if you need to see it . \nif divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood suffers from a ploddingly melodramatic structure , it comes to life in the performances . \nif you ignore the cliches and concentrate on city by the sea\'s interpersonal drama , it ain\'t half-bad . \nalternates between deadpan comedy and heartbreaking loneliness and isn\'t afraid to provoke introspection in both its characters and its audience . \nthere aren\'t too many films that can be as simultaneously funny , offbeat and heartwarming ( without a thick shmear of the goo , at least ) , but " elling " manages to do all three quite well , making it one of the year\'s most enjoyable releases . \nreign of fire is hardly the most original fantasy film ever made -- beyond road warrior , it owes enormous debts to aliens and every previous dragon drama -- but that barely makes it any less entertaining . \nan earnest , roughshod document , it serves as a workable primer for the region\'s recent history , and would make a terrific 10th-grade learning tool . \nsamuel beckett applied to the iranian voting process . \nthe bard as black comedy -- willie would have loved it . \nanother trumpet blast that there may be a new mexican cinema a-bornin\' . \n\' . . . the film\'s considered approach to its subject matter is too calm and thoughtful for agitprop , and the thinness of its characterizations makes it a failure as straight drama . \'\ntadpole may be one of the most appealing movies ever made about an otherwise appalling , and downright creepy , subject -- a teenage boy in love with his stepmother . \nthis is a story that zings all the way through with originality , humour and pathos . \nas underwater ghost stories go , below casts its spooky net out into the atlantic ocean and spits it back , grizzled and charred , somewhere northwest of the bermuda triangle . \nit is a challenging film , if not always a narratively cohesive one . \ntrapped won\'t score points for political correctness , but it may cause parents a few sleepless hours -- a sign of its effectiveness . \na rock-solid gangster movie with a fair amount of suspense , intriguing characters and bizarre bank robberies , plus a heavy dose of father-and-son dynamics . \nit\'s incredible the number of stories the holocaust has generated . just when you think that every possible angle has been exhausted by documentarians , another new film emerges with yet another remarkable yet shockingly little-known perspective . \nas they used to say in the 1950s sci-fi movies , signs is a tribute to shyamalan\'s gifts , which are such that we\'ll keep watching the skies for his next project . \nthere\'s no conversion effort , much of the writing is genuinely witty and both stars are appealing enough to probably have a good shot at a hollywood career , if they want one . \nlike a skillful fisher , the director uses the last act to reel in the audience since its poignancy hooks us completely . \na film with contemporary political resonance illustrated by a winning family story . \nkids five and up will be delighted with the fast , funny , and even touching story . parents may even find that it goes by quickly , because it has some of the funniest jokes of any movie this year , including those intended for adults . \nan unsettling , memorable cinematic experience that does its predecessors proud . \nmaid in manhattan might not look so appealing on third or fourth viewing down the road . . . but as a high concept vehicle for two bright stars of the moment who can rise to fans\' lofty expectations , the movie passes inspection . \nmuch of all about lily chou-chou is mesmerizing : some of its plaintiveness could make you weep . \nferrara\'s strongest and most touching movie of recent years . \nspielberg\'s first real masterpiece , it deserved all the hearts it won -- and wins still , 20 years later . \nthe screenwriters dig themselves in deeper every time they toss logic and science into what is essentially a " dungeons and dragons " fantasy with modern military weaponry . . . \nmore than simply a portrait of early extreme sports , this peek into the 1970s skateboard revolution is a skateboard film as social anthropology . . . \nwhat i saw , i enjoyed . \ngood-naturedly cornball sequel . \nthe level of acting elevates the material above pat inspirational status and gives it a sturdiness and solidity that we\'ve long associated with washington the actor . \na deft , delightful mix of sulky teen drama and overcoming-obstacles sports-movie triumph . \ndaringly perceptive , taut , piercing and feisty , biggie and tupac is undeniably subversive and involving in its bold presentation . \ndelivers more than its fair share of saucy hilarity . \na fairly enjoyable mixture of longest yard . . . and the 1999 guy ritchie caper lock stock and two smoking barrels . \nhappily , some things are immune to the folly of changing taste and attitude . for proof of that on the cinematic front , look no further than this 20th anniversary edition of the film that spielberg calls , retrospectively , his most personal work yet . \nhugely entertaining from start to finish , featuring a fall from grace that still leaves shockwaves , it will gratify anyone who has ever suspected hollywood of being overrun by corrupt and hedonistic weasels . \nit\'s not like having a real film of nijinsky , but at least it\'s better than that eponymous 1980 biopic that used soap in the places where the mysteries lingered . \nit\'s probably worth catching solely on its visual merits . if only it had the story to match . \nlike other great documentaries . . . this goes after one truth ( the ford administration\'s complicity in tearing \'orphans\' from their mothers ) and stumbles upon others even more compelling . \n . . . only bond can save us from the latest eccentric , super-wealthy megalomaniac bent on world domination and destruction . \nthe first half bursts with a goofy energy previous disney films only used for a few minutes here and there . \nit\'s quite diverting nonsense . \nan old-fashioned scary movie , one that relies on lingering terror punctuated by sudden shocks and not constant bloodshed punctuated by flying guts . \nfor all the wit and hoopla , festival in cannes offers rare insight into the structure of relationships . \nwhat makes how i killed my father compelling , besides its terrific performances , is fontaine\'s willingness to wander into the dark areas of parent-child relationships without flinching . \nrenner ? s face is chillingly unemotive , yet he communicates a great deal in his performance . see it for his performance if nothing else . \n . . . the kind of entertainment that parents love to have their kids see . \nit\'s a fine , focused piece of work that reopens an interesting controversy and never succumbs to sensationalism . \nits engaging simplicity is driven by appealing leads . \nswimming is above all about a young woman\'s face , and by casting an actress whose face projects that woman\'s doubts and yearnings , it succeeds . \na respectable venture on its own terms , lacking the broader vision that has seen certain trek films . . . cross over to a more mainstream audience . \nit\'s weird , wonderful , and not necessarily for kids . \nan elegant film with often surprising twists and an intermingling of naivet\xe9 and sophistication . \nblessed with two fine , nuanced lead performances . \nwhile this has the making of melodrama , the filmmaker cuts against this natural grain , producing a work that\'s more interested in asking questions than in answering them . \nas a girl-meets-girl romantic comedy , kissing jessica steinis quirky , charming and often hilarious . yet it\'s not quite the genre-busting film it\'s been hyped to be because it plays everything too safe . \nyou don\'t need to know your ice-t\'s from your cool-j\'s to realize that as far as these shootings are concerned , something is rotten in the state of california . \nturturro is fabulously funny and over the top as a \'very sneaky\' butler who excels in the art of impossible disappearing/reappearing acts\nmeant for star wars fans . it is there to give them a good time . \nfrom a deceptively simple premise , this deeply moving french drama develops a startling story that works both as a detailed personal portrait and as a rather frightening examination of modern times . \nsimply and eloquently articulates the tangled feelings of particular new yorkers deeply touched by an unprecedented tragedy . \nprovides a very moving and revelatory footnote to the holocaust . \nterrific performances , great to look at , and funny . a little uneven to be the cat\'s meow , but it\'s good enough to be the purr . \nit\'s a compelling and horrifying story , and the laramie project is worthwhile for reminding us that this sort of thing does , in fact , still happen in america . \ni like it . there is a freedom to watching stunts that are this crude , this fast-paced and this insane . \nthat rare documentary that incorporates so much of human experience -- drama , conflict , tears and surprise
